#NAME

ifcreate - Creates dependency on non-existence of targets.

#SYNOPSIS

redux ifcreate [TARGET...]

#OPTIONS

  -?=false: Show help

  -h=false: Show help

  -help=false: Show help



#NOTES


The ifcreate command creates a dependency on the non-existence of the target files.
The current file will be invalidated if the target comes into existence.
If the target exists, the command returns an error.


#DESCRIPTION

This command can be invoked as `redux ifcreate` or, through a symlink, as `redo-ifcreate`.

The `ifcreate` command marks the current target as out of date when a
non-existent prerequisite file comes into existence or is deleted.

This command should be placed in a do file and not run directly.
